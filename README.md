## wallpapez - totes papes, bro
this is my personal collection of wallpapers. i have tried to organize them, based on the theme i was aiming for at the time. 

the two main sources are wallhaven and deviantart, and i regret having not saved the source zipfiles for the things i acquired from DA. if you happen to see work that you can help me attribute, i would appreciate it! even a random nudge to remind me to go do some hunting myself would be nice. :)

with the exception of the `wh-windows` folder - obviously for any windows install i use - i generally do not worry alot about my wallpapers, with the exception of any distro where i use a window manager like `i3`, `awesome`, etc. 

i usually like to manage the wallpaper with `feh`, and then use `wal` (`pip3 install pywal`) as a way to generate colors from the wallpaper, and `blurwal` (`pip3 install blurwal`) to apply a gorgeous effect, which is a pleasant blurring that fades in and remains while a window is open on the desktop. (this can be configured, ie trigger the effect when >2 windows are open etc)

i believe a little searching around will reveal a more straightforward script called `feh-blur` which skips the wal+blurwal method and will apply a blur to your background when it has been set with feh. i'll try to find a copy and include it here if possible.
